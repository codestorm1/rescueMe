This version of Animal Rescue Management System:

Started off with samples from the book Getting MEAN
added User schema, mongoose, and unit testing from the mean.io sample
cloned ARMS code from textola

Added animal controller, default controller to handle generic crud.
With the default controller, simply adding a mongoose schema will make crud endpoints available
